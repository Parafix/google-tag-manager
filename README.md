# Google Tag Manager
Although GTM is pretty easy to set up the basics of GA tracking for websites, there are several ways to use and set up a GTM container (tags, rules, variables, folders). When going into advanced and custom settings, there can be a difference in tag usage, which means that you actually can't build a one-fits-all container to share.

# Purpose of this repository
I want to help you build a clear, understandable and easy to use Analytics framework for Google Analytics. This will contribute to a better and cleaner tracking, more useful data and meaningful analysis . After all, too many people haven't invested in proper tracking, naming convention and useful integrations yet, hence why the probability is very high that, in this case, webdata isn't currently a core asset in their business & marketing department.

# Boilertemplate
